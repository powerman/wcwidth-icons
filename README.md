# wcwidth-icons

Support fonts with double-width icons in xterm/rxvt-unicode/zsh/vim/…

If fonts with icons like [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/)
are used with some terminals like rxvt-unicode then icons must have
single-width (Nerd Fonts calls this "Mono" font, generated by Nerd Fonts
Font Patcher with option `--use-single-width-glyphs`) to work correctly.
**This makes icons too small (about ¼ of normal size for most icons).**

To fix this for most applications (like xterm/rxvt-unicode/zsh/…) which
use libc function (like `wcwidth(3)` or `wcswidth(3)`) to get symbol width
you can use provided library in `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable.

To fix some other applications (like vim) you may need to build these
applications with extra patch, provided in [patches/](patches/) directory.

With these fixes you should use Nerd Fonts with "Propo" font name suffix
instead of "Mono".
